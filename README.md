Challenge
An institution decided to conduct research involving virtual assistants with the ability to identify people's emotions through their facial expressions, aiming to determine the most appropriate customer service approach based on their emotion. In this scenario, it was decided to develop a program that categorizes people's emotions based on this simplified facial analysis. Your task is to create a function that receives a list with the intensity of each facial feature of a person and returns the predominant emotion without using external libraries.

Input
The input will be a string with 4 numbers separated by commas (,) representing the intensity of 4 distinct emotions, where each index in this list represents, respectively, the emotions: Anger, Happiness, Sadness, and Surprise.

Output
The expected output is the name of the predominant emotion.

Challenge
You are part of a development team at a financial institution. Recently, the team was given the important task of improving the fraud detection system in financial transactions. To do this, it is necessary to develop an algorithm, without the use of libraries, capable of identifying suspicious patterns in bank transactions equal to or greater than the corresponding fraud limit for that account.

Input
The input consists of: n, which corresponds to the number of transactions to be analyzed, followed by lists referring to the transactions, each consisting of three values: an id, the transaction value and the fraud threshold value.

Output
The expected output is the ids of the suspicious transactions.
