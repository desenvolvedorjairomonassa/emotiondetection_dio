Challenge
An institution decided to conduct research involving virtual assistants with the ability to identify people's emotions through their facial expressions, aiming to determine the most appropriate customer service approach based on their emotion. In this scenario, it was decided to develop a program that categorizes people's emotions based on this simplified facial analysis. Your task is to create a function that receives a list with the intensity of each facial feature of a person and returns the predominant emotion without using external libraries.

Input
The input will be a string with 4 numbers separated by commas (,) representing the intensity of 4 distinct emotions, where each index in this list represents, respectively, the emotions: Anger, Happiness, Sadness, and Surprise.

Output
The expected output is the name of the predominant emotion.
